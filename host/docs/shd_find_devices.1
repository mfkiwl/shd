.SH NAME
shd_find_devices \- SMINI Hardware Driver Discovery Utility
.SH DESCRIPTION
Find SHD-supporting Ettus Research products attached by USB,
network or embedded configuration.
.LP
The SHD package is the universal hardware driver for Ettus Research
products. The goal is to provide a host driver and API for
current and future Ettus Research products. Users will be able to use
the SHD driver standalone or with 3rd party applications.

.SH IDENTIFYING DEVICES
.sp
Devices are addressed through key/value string pairs.
These string pairs can be used to narrow down the search for a specific device or group of devices.
Most SHD utility applications and examples have a \-\-args parameter that takes a device address,
where the device address is expressed as a delimited string.
See the documentation in types/device_addr.hpp for reference.

Every device has several ways of identifying it on the host system.
.SS Identifying by hardware identifier
.sp

All Ettus Research devices can be found through their hardware series identifier, which match to
devices as follows:

Argument       |  Device

type=smini1     |  SMINI1

type=smini2     |  SMINI2, SMINI N200, SMINI N210

type=b100      |  SMINI B100

type=b200      |  SMINI B200, SMINI B210

type=e100      |  SMINI E100, SMINI E110

type=e3x0      |  SMINI E310

type=x300      |  SMINI X300, SMINI X310

type=octoclock |  OctoClock

.SS Identifying by serial number

All Ettus Research devices are given a unique serial number, which can be used to identify a device as follows:

serial=12345678

.SS Identifying by IP address

SMINI2, SMINI N200, SMINI N210, SMINI X300, SMINI X310, and OctoClock devices connected to the host machine can all be found through their
IP addresses, as follows:

addr=192.168.10.2

.SS Identifying by name

Users have the option of giving their devices short names using the smini_burn_mb_eeprom and octoclock_burn_eeprom
utilities in lib/shd/utils. Devices that have been given a name can be identified as follows:

name=foo

.fi
.SH EXAMPLES

Device address arguments can be supplied to narrow the scope of the search.
