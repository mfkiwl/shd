Welcome to the SMINI Hardware Driver (SHD) manual. Here, you will find information on how to use the devices and how to use the API to connect to them through your own software.

This manual is split into two parts: The device manual, and the SHD/API manual. The first part describes details of our devices, mainboards and daughterboards, as well as aspects of _using_ SHD.

The second is meant for developers writing SHD-based applications, and includes descriptions of the API, sorted by namespaces, classes and files.

Follow these links to get to the section of the manual you wish to consult, or use the browser in the left sidebar. A search bar is also available at the top right, but note that this only works on API components. For information on how to build and install SHD, go to the SHD web site (see below).
